\section{Abstract}

The following work analyzes the ecosystems of IPFS, blockchain, and Hyphanet/Freenet, along with their tooling used to develop and deploy community applications in a distributed and decentralized manner.

This is achieved through the implementation of three use cases that illustrate different features: a static website, a knowledge repository, and a real-time messenger, from which a qualitative and quantitative analysis of each ecosystem is conducted.
