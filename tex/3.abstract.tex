\section{Abstract}

The present work analyzes the ecosystems of IPFS, Ethereum, and Hyphanet/Freenet, along with their associated tools, with the aim of evaluating their use in the development and deployment of community applications in a distributed and decentralized manner.

This is achieved through the implementation of three use cases that illustrate different requirements: a static website, a knowledge repository, and a real-time messenger, from which a qualitative and quantitative analysis of each ecosystem is conducted.
