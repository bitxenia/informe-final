\section{Abstract}

The following work analyzes different ecosystems and technologies that can be used to deploy community web applications in a distributed and decentralized manner.

This is achieved developing three use cases that illustrate different features: an informational website, a knowledge repository and a real-time messenger. The advantages and disadvantages of deploying each of them on IPFS, blockchain and Hyphanet/Freenet are compared, and the process to do so is documented.
